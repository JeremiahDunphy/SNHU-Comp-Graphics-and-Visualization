# How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I focus on clarity, modularity, and alignment with the project goals. For my 3D scene in OpenGL, I emphasized creating realistic and relatable objects that demonstrate the use of basic geometric primitives, transformations, and textures. The design was guided by the need to ensure functionality while making the scene visually engaging and intuitive for users. A workspace environment was chosen as it is relatable and allowed for diverse geometric representations.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project enhanced my ability to:

Implement modular designs for better code reusability and maintainability.
Apply geometric transformations (scaling, rotation, translation) effectively to model realistic objects.
Utilize texture mapping and material properties to achieve surface realism.
Design dynamic and user-friendly navigation systems using input devices like the keyboard and mouse.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process began with planning the objects and their interactions in the scene, followed by implementing geometric primitives and textures to enhance realism. Modular functions like SetTransformations and RenderScene ensured that the project was scalable and maintainable. The design incorporated user feedback and testing to refine functionality, such as dynamic camera control and intuitive navigation.

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The modularity and emphasis on reusability in this project can be applied to any future software design, ensuring that components are easy to update or replace. Techniques such as dynamic camera control, efficient texture management, and modular rendering functions are valuable for any 3D graphics or game development project.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I approach development iteratively, starting with a strong foundation and gradually adding complexity. For the 3D scene, I first developed basic shapes and transformations, then layered on textures, lighting, and navigation controls. I also prioritize testing and debugging at every stage to ensure stability.

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The use of modularized transformation and rendering functions was a key strategy. Functions like RenderCoffeeCup and RenderKeyboard encapsulated object-specific logic, while central functions like RenderScene managed the overall rendering process. These strategies improved maintainability and allowed for incremental updates.

# How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a critical role in refining the 3D scene. For example, the camera controls were iteratively improved based on user experience, and lighting positions were adjusted to achieve balanced illumination. Each iteration brought the project closer to the desired level of functionality and polish.

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach has evolved to emphasize planning and modularity. Early milestones focused on foundational elements like object creation and basic navigation, while later stages added textures, lighting, and shaders. Each milestone built upon the previous, demonstrating the importance of a phased approach to complex projects.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills and technical expertise to create innovative solutions. This project demonstrated the potential of computational graphics to build realistic, interactive environments, which is a valuable skill in fields like gaming, simulation, and virtual reality.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Working on this project deepened my understanding of 3D modeling, transformations, and rendering pipelines. These skills are foundational for advanced studies in fields like game development, animation, or virtual reality, where computational graphics are integral.
